py_auto_bot
===========

Getting Started
---------------

Spending hours for manual tasks in different applications?

Sending reminding notifications to co-workers, family in Whatsapp, Telergam,
making boring routine tasks for reports, games and much more.

There are some expansive apps that doesn’t have necessary functionality.

Freeware apps and libraries are far from real bot with scenarios and AI in image
recognitions and predictions.

I’m writing it as personal project to free my time.

Schedule:

1.  make basic bot on pyautogui with scenarios to process.

2.  make simple GUI feedback processing bot to “understand” fails/successes in
    actions;

3.  for exceptions in scenarios need to ask manual action. Planning simple
    Telegram integration;

4.  for monitoring process planning to use web server asyncio (server side) +
    vue.js (client side)

5.  for overview of process add reporting services;

6.  add AI in image recognition (simple matching is bad for games with updates
    and themes);

7.  add AI for predictions. Some games could use prediction models for best
    score for example “Three in a row” and other player models in multiplayer
    games etc.

### Prerequisites

It depends on pyautogui (pip install pyautogui)

### Installing

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a
little demo
